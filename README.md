Plots graphs in 3D
Might or might not add imaginary/complex graphs that graphs dynamically, but at the moment it's pretty crappy.

Libraies used:
  - ExprTK for parsing and evaluation maths equations
  - OpenGL and GLUT for graphics
  
/* Important! */
  - glu32.dll must be in the same folder as Plot.exe

/* To do list */
1. Convert graphs to Argand diagram
2. Fix up quadratic/ cubic imaginary graphs (make them a bit more dynamic)
3. Clean up code (it's very messy atm and unreadable)
