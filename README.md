<strong>What is Plot?</strong><br/>
Plot is an open source plotting/graphing tool that plots/graphs in 3D. <br/>
Might or might not add imaginary/complex graphs that graphs dynamically, but at the moment it's pretty crappy.

Libraies used:
  - ExprTK for parsing and evaluation maths equations
  - OpenGL and GLUT for graphics
  
/* Important! */ <br/>
  - glu32.dll must be in the same folder as Plot.exe

/* To do list */ <br/>
1. Convert graphs to Argand diagram <br/>
2. Fix up quadratic/ cubic imaginary graphs (make them a bit more dynamic) <br/>
3. Clean up code (it's very messy atm and unreadable) <br/>
